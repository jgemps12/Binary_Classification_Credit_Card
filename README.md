# Credit Card Approval Classification

## About this Project:
This project uses **machine learning** techniques in Python to solve a **binary classification** problem. This problem focuses on whether a person who applied for a credit card should be:

> **0** - ***rejected*** due to bad credit.

> **1** - ***approved*** due to good credit.

Two different datasets (**application_record.csv** and **credit_record.csv**) contain a total of 20 columns, or **attributes**. Selected attributes, such as car ownership and yearly income,
serve as **predictors** for a client's creditworthiness. Several different **k** configurations of the **k-Neighbors Classifier** model are then implemented with those predictors. 

Once the model finishes its predictions, metrics such as **F1 score** and **mean stratified k-fold cross validation score** are reviewed to determine the ideal model configuration.

## Dataset:
This project uses the ***Credit_Card_Approval_Prediction*** dataset from Kaggle. 

Due to Kaggle's licensing terms, the dataset is not included in this repository.
